# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Unfortunately, this was not a week I was able to devote to this work as much as I'd like to. Most of it was whipped up today after work so it's nowhere near complete, but there's just no way I could work on this more tonight, so I'm turning in what I can.

I was able to get the HTML more or less into what I thought it should be, it was just a matter of getting everything functional. I got the date that was necessary, but the localStorage solution was only about halfway finished. I wasn't even able to take a look at the past/present/future color formatting. I'd like to go back and keep working on this once there's a little more time, and I'm hoping that will be these coming weeks between the group project.

# Acceptance Criteria

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
